### Inheritance Project

### April 7, 2016

Inheritance project that showcases both a class for People and Animals:

* Create interface and class structures for IPerson used by Employee; subclasses of Employee are Teacher, Janitor, and Counselor. Include relevant test to showcase functionality. Include two properties and two functions inside the interface. Create at least one additional property and function for each of the 3 subclasses. Allow the toString method to extend functionality over changing it. Use relavant access modifiers. Also include at least one property and method which uses the final modifier on both a property and function (ex: birthDate, calcAge). Include relavant tests to showcase classes. Include abstract classes where needed.

* Create the following class structure:
IAnimal (method makeNoise) which is an interface used by Animal subclasses of Cat, Bird, Fish, subclasses Lion, Tiger/ Parrot, Penguin / Shark, Killer Whale â€“ Create the class Zoo which contains a property zooAnimals, an array of IZooAnimal objects (the interface IZooAnimal extends IAnimal and contains the method performTrick). The class Zoo should contains a method doShow() which showcases the animals at the Zoo. Include abstract classes where needed. You may want to diagram this structure and show it to me before implementing it!
